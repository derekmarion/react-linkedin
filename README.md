# LinkedIn Profile Recreation in Vite + React.js

In this assignment, you will recreate a simplified version of your LinkedIn profile using the Vite and React.js environment. This assignment focuses on structuring and styling your LinkedIn profile without any backend functionality.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this assignment, make sure you have Vite and React.js set up in your development environment. You can refer to the official documentation for installation instructions.

## Task 1: Think Through the Structure

1. Analyze your LinkedIn profile to understand its structure and elements. Take note of the different sections, such as the cover photo, profile photo, name, title, about me, job history, education, and any other relevant sections.

## Task 2: Set Up the Structure in React

1. Create a new React application using Vite or your preferred setup.

2. Inside your React project, set up the structure for your LinkedIn profile by creating React components. Each component should represent a section or element from your LinkedIn profile.

3. Nest components as needed to represent the hierarchy of elements on your profile. For example:

   ```jsx
   <LinkedInProfile>
     <CoverPhoto />
     <ProfileHeader>
       <ProfilePhoto />
       <ProfileInfo />
     </ProfileHeader>
     <AboutMe />
     <JobHistory />
     <Education />
     {/* Add more sections as needed */}
   </LinkedInProfile>
   ```

## Task 3: Add Content

1. Within each React component, add the content to simulate your LinkedIn profile. This content should include text and images to represent your profile, but leave the styling out for now. Focus on creating the skeleton of your profile.

## Task 4: Style It

1. Create a separate CSS file (e.g., styles.css) or use a CSS-in-JS solution to style your components. You can add styles for elements, positioning, and layout, similar to your LinkedIn profile.

2. Use CSS properties like `display` and `position` to position elements on the page correctly.

3. Include the CSS file in your React project by using a `<link>` tag or importing it into your components.

4. Apply styles to make your LinkedIn profile replica look as similar as possible to your real LinkedIn profile. Pay attention to details like spacing, fonts, colors, and element placement.

## Task 5: Testing

1. Test your LinkedIn profile replica by running your React application. Make sure all elements are correctly structured and styled.
